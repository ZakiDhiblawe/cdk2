# Application of Machine Learning in Identifying Risk Factors for Chronic Kidney Disease

## Project Description

### Title
**Application of Machine Learning in Identifying Risk Factors for Chronic Kidney Disease**

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based system for the early detection and prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). By leveraging data from patient records, the system aims to provide an accurate diagnosis that can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

## Project Idea and Community Impact

### Project Idea
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a significant health concern that often goes undiagnosed until it reaches an advanced stage. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of CKD, thus facilitating early detection and treatment. By integrating this system into a user-friendly web interface, healthcare providers can quickly and accurately assess patients' kidney health.

### Community Impact
this project can have a profound impact by:
- Enabling early detection and treatment of CKD, potentially reducing morbidity and mortality rates.
- Reducing the burden on healthcare facilities by enabling remote diagnosis and monitoring.
- Empowering healthcare providers with data-driven tools to improve patient care and outcomes.
- Raising awareness about CKD and encouraging regular health screenings.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Develop a machine learning model that can predict CKD based on patient data.
- Create a user-friendly web application that integrates this model for use by healthcare providers.
- Enhance the capacity of the healthcare system to diagnose and treat CKD effectively.

## How the Project Works
The project consists of two main components: a machine learning model and a web application.

### Machine Learning Model
- **Data Source**: The model uses a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which includes patient information and medical records.
- **Algorithm**: A Random Forest Classifier is used to predict CKD. This model has been chosen for its accuracy and ability to handle complex datasets.
- **Training and Testing**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to measure its effectiveness.

### Web Application
- **Framework**: The application is built using PHP for the front end and Flask for the back end. The Flask API handles predictions using the trained machine learning model.
- **Functionality**: Users can register, log in, add and manage patient information, and view CKD prediction results.
- **Deployment**: The application is deployed on a subdomain (http://cdk.great-site.net), making it accessible to healthcare providers.

## Significance to the Community
- **Early Detection**: By identifying CKD in its early stages, patients can receive timely treatment, potentially slowing the progression of the disease.
- **Accessibility**: The web application is accessible from any device with an internet connection, making it usable in both urban and rural areas.
- **Efficiency**: Automating the diagnosis process saves time for healthcare providers, allowing them to focus on patient care.
- **Education**: The project raises awareness about CKD, encouraging regular check-ups and preventive measures.

## Use Cases
1. **Hospitals**: Utilize the system for early detection and continuous monitoring of CKD in patients.
2. **Clinics**: Implement the tool for quick and reliable CKD screening during outpatient visits.
3. **Pharmacies**: Assist pharmacists in understanding patients' conditions to provide better medication management.
4. **Doctors**: Provide nephrologists and general practitioners with a decision support tool to enhance diagnosis accuracy.
